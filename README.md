# Applying Schrödinger Bridge Methods to Generative Modeling of Financial Time Series

## Introduction
This repository presents an implementation of the Schrödinger bridge (SB) approach for generative modeling of financial time series. The SB method offers a novel framework for modeling time series data, leveraging entropic interpolation via optimal transport to capture the temporal dynamics of financial markets. 

## Implementation Details
The code provided here is tailored specifically for financial time series data. It implements the SB approach described in the literature, offering functionalities to estimate the drift function from historical data samples and simulate synthetic time series data.

## Master's Thesis
This project is part of a master's thesis titled "Applying Schrödinger Bridge Methods to Generative Modeling of Financial Time Series." The thesis aims to explore the effectiveness and practical implications of SB methods in financial data generation.

### Notebooks
- `onedim-slow.ipynb`: Notebook for one-dimensional financial time series data, such as stock prices or index returns.


## Performance Evaluation
The performance of the generative model is evaluated through various experiments on financial datasets, assessing metrics such as accuracy, robustness, and applicability to real-world scenarios.

## Future Work
This repository serves as a foundation for ongoing research in applying SB methods to financial time series. Future work includes refining the model, exploring alternative estimation techniques, and expanding the evaluation on diverse financial datasets.
